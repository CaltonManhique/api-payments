# API EasyTrain Payments

This API was developed to simulate the payment system of the easytrain application for more realistic testing purposes. In the future, this component will be replaced by connections to paypal, mastercard, klarna, etc.

## Concept
Spring Boot RestAPI
The API is only accessible for GET requests. Requests must be made by sending the card details and the ticket value, card number, CVC and expiry date encrypted for security.
